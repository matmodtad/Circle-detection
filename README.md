# Geometry Estimation Project

This repository contains my submission for the task 1.2: **Geometry Estimation Assignment**.

## Files

- **Task_Computer_Vision_Engineer_JR_1043089.pdf** – Original assignment description.  
- **hough_circles.ipynb** – My proposed solution implementing circle detection using Hough Transform in Python. Due to limited time, I chose Python, in which I currently feel more confident, and was not able to refresh my C++ skills.  
- **analysis.pdf** – Theoretical analysis and discussion of the assignment, including methodology and reasoning behind the approach.
